# SecureBank-Cybersecurity
This repository presents a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment project designed around a simulated banking environment. The project demonstrates how a financial institution can systematically identify, assess, and mitigate cyber risks that threaten customer data, critical systems, and core banking infrastructure. It reflects real-world security challenges faced by banks and applies structured, risk-based decision-making to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

The repository documents the full lifecycle of a banking cybersecurity assessment, beginning with business context definition and asset identification. Key assets include customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII), transaction records, core banking applications, authentication systems, networks, and supporting infrastructure. These assets are classified according to sensitivity and business impact, ensuring that security controls are prioritized where risk is highest.

A detailed threat modeling phase examines realistic attack scenarios such as phishing and credential theft, insider misuse of privileged access, malware and ransomware attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and exploitation of misconfigured systems. Each threat is evaluated based on likelihood and potential impact to banking operations, customer trust, and regulatory obligations. This approach ensures that risks are assessed from both technical and business perspectives.

Based on the identified risks, the project proposes layered security controls that reflect industry best practices. These controls include encryption of data at rest and in transit, role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, network segmentation, secure configuration baselines, centralized logging, continuous monitoring, and incident response planning. Together, these measures illustrate a defense-in-depth strategy suitable for modern financial institutions.

To demonstrate governance and compliance readiness, all controls are mapped to recognized cybersecurity standards. The project aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, following the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions. It also incorporates principles from ISO/IEC 27001 to support information security management and PCI DSS to address payment and transaction security requirements.

This repository is intended as both a learning resource and a professional portfolio artifact. It is suitable for cybersecurity students and early-career professionals seeking to demonstrate practical skills in risk assessment, threat modeling, control implementation, and framework-based security design within the banking sector.
